I. Adding Your Own Logo

Use the theme options panel to add your own logo.

II. Customizing the template.

Please user a child theme for customizations. Alternatively, you can use a Custom CSS plugin.

III. Using the Full-Width Template

The full-width template lets you create a page (not a post) without a sidebar easily. To do so, select "Full Width" in the Page Attributes>Template section on the page editing screen.

IV. Using Featured Images and Subtitles on Posts

The default front page is configured to automatically display a post's featured image and subtitle below the article headline. The feature image will not be automatically added to the individual post page itself; you'll need to insert it into the content to display it on the full article page.

Subtitles are displayed on individual article pages and the home page (latest post). To add an article subtitle, use the meta box below the WordPress post editor.

V. Sticky Posts

Sticky posts will be displayed as "Featured Posts" just like the latest post. Use this option if you want to feature

a breaking story for a length of time, with your other posts appearing below it.

VI. Custom Post Templates

To use custom post templates, install the Custom Post Templates plugin:

http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-template/

The theme includes a full-width post template for use with the plugin.

VII. Page of Blog Posts

Use the Blog Posts Page template to display recent blog posts on a static page. Do not set the page as the "Posts" page in the Settings>Reading Panel.

VIII. Featured Post Management

Use the tag "featured" on posts you want to promote to the home page top area. Be sure to activate this option in the theme options panel.

VIV. Responsive archive videos

The theme takes advantage of WP's post formats, with particular attention to the video post type. If you want your videos to show up rather than an excerpt on your 

home page and other archive pages, choose the "Video" post type and place your video embed code in the Featured Video meta box. The post will now show a responsive, 

full-column width video rather than the excerpt/thumbnail.

X. Featured content videos

If you want a video to be shown in the featured content area (home page), rather than a thumbnail, place your video embed code in the Feature Video meta box. This will override the thumbnail in the featured content area, displaying the video. The featured video will also display at the top of the single post page.
